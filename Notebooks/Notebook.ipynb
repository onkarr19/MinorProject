    "check(''' \" quest for camelot \" is warner bros . ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . \n",
    "the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production \" anastasia , \" but disney's \" hercules , \" with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation . \n",
    "this year , it's no contest , as \" quest for camelot \" is pretty much dead on arrival . \n",
    "even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be \" pocahontas \" for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this . \n",
    "the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table . \n",
    "kayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . \n",
    "with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side . \n",
    " \" quest for camelot \" is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . \n",
    "there's nothing here that differentiates \" quest \" from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . \n",
    " ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra . \n",
    "i rest my case . ) \n",
    "even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . \n",
    "in the end , it's a tie -- they all win . \n",
    "that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . \n",
    "at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel \" urkel \" white and bronson \" balki \" pinchot sharing the same footage . \n",
    "a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . \n",
    "but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . \n",
    "aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , \" quest for camelot \" 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . \n",
    "and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . \n",
